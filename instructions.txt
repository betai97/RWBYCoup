How to use portmapper for RWBY Coup hosting:

Note: If someone else is hosting and you are connecting, you don't need to worry about any of this

(1) Open portmapper jar
(2) Click create
(3) Add a description (something informative like RWBY portmap or something)
(4) Make sure internal client IP listed is the correct one for your network card. You can
check this by opening cmd.exe, typing "ipconfig", and scrolling to "Wireless LAN adapter wifi"
(if you're using wifi), and checking that the IPv4 address listed matches. If they don't match, 
uncheck "Use local host" in the portmapper program, and change the IP to the correct one listed in the cmd.exe. 
(5) Click add
(6) Make the internal and external ports both 2222
(7) Make sure protocol is TCP (it should be anyway by default)
(8) Click save
(9) Click connect. If it gives any sort of error in the log messages, click portmapper settings and 
switch the upnp library to something else, and try clicking connect again.
(10) Click the created mapping you made in the "port mapping presets" section; it should have
the description you gave it before
(11) click use
(12) The log messages section should say something like:
INFO  adding port mapping RWBYPortmap
INFO  adding port mapping ()
INFO  1 port mapping added successfully
INFO  Found 8 mappings

If it says something like this, then you are done, and can proceed to opening the RWBYCoup program, 
hosting, and sharing the displayed IP with the other players.
