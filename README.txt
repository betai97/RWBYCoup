Windows:
You probably want to download and run the setup.exe file, it is bundled with the correct java version, and 
has a game icon. You can still use the Coup.jar file, but you will have to make sure that you have java 8
installed on your computer.

Mac/Linux:
Make sure java 8 is installed, and run the Coup.jar file.

Hosting the game:
If you are hosting the game, you need to set up port forwarding to port 2222. You can either log into your router and do this,
or use the UPnP Port mapper program to do it, following the instructions.txt file.
If you are connecting to someone else's game, no need to do anything.
